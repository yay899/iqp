	\section{Introduction}
		This section will contain our research questions, and what we did to answer them (research, surveys, data analysis. Prefacing all of this will be the definition of some important terms that are used throughout the paper. Most of our research questions are outlined in another document.
		
	\section{Basics of Artificial Intelligence}
		This section will contain an explanation of what artificial intelligence is, and a brief history on it. It will then delve into the difference between procedural AI and learning AI to give a background on how learning AI could have vastly different ethical implications and require different regulation. How weights and the like function will be explained.

	\section{General Ethics}
		This section will go into the basic definition of ethics before going into more detail about how ethics apply to medical devices. There will also be some stuff on the legal and ethical considerations of using electronic health records as training data for learning AI.

	\section{Expectations of Medical AI}
		This section will go into how nurses and patients view medical AI, as well as how they expect it to function. This will make heavy use of gathered survey data and highlight both differences between the two groups, and just general areas that could cause some concern if they are not kept in mind while developing medical applications of machine learning.

	\section{Benefits of Medical AI}
		This section will go into what sort of benefits medical AI may be able to provide regardless of what people expect of it. It will bring up how it can lighten the workload of overworked healthcare professionals, and how it may lead to better treatment selection by pulling from data a human would not expect to be relevant.

	\section{Risks of Medical AI}
		This section will go into the various risks that may emerge from medical AI. It will also cover what could be done to mitigate this through good practices enforced by FDA regulations, and some form of approved automated routine maintenance. It will go deeper into what sorts of regulations could potentially be both helpful and actually manageable for companies to meet.

	\section{Balance of Regulation Against the Free Market}
		This section will go into detail on the pros and cons of high and low regulation, emphasizing both the massive increase in risk that comes with low regulations and how high regulations could strangle innovation.
