    abstract = {When end users apply a machine learning (ML) model on new unlabeled data, it is difficult for them to decide whether they can trust its predictions. Errors or shifts in the target data can lead to hard-to-detect drops in the predictive quality of the model. We therefore propose an approach to assist non-ML experts working with pretrained ML models. Our approach estimates the change in prediction performance of a model on unseen target data. It does not require explicit distributional assumptions on the dataset shift between the training and target data. Instead, a domain expert can declaratively specify typical cases of dataset shift that she expects to observe in real-world data. Based on this information, we learn a performance predictor for pretrained black box models, which can be combined with the model, and automatically warns end users in case of unexpected performance drops. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on two models -- logistic regression and a neural network, applied to several real-world datasets.},
    annotate = {This regards the difficulty of validating the predictions of a machine learning (ML) models when errors in the input data induce unwanted and unknown changes in the model's weights. This is difficult due to it being legitimately hard to confirm if predictions are correct or not until whatever they predict has come to pass, and frequently this involves making unrealistic assumptions on the nature of possible dataset shifts. Emphasis is placed on the lack of availability of validation tools for use by non-ML experts. Unfortunately, the article only really goes into detecting problems, and states that the user should contact an ML expert in the event of degredation in the predictive model. That solution that is proposed seems interesting.}

This research area tackles the important problem that complex machines and algorithms often cannot provide insights into their behavior and thought processes. XAI allows users and parts of the internal system to be more transparent, providing explanations of their decisions in some level of detail. These explanations are important to ensure algorithmic fairness, identify potential bias/problems in the training data, and to ensure that the algorithms perform as expected. However, explanations produced by these systems is neither standardized nor systematically assessed. In an effort to create best practices and identify open challenges, we describe foundational concepts of explainability and show how they can be used to classify existing literature. We discuss why current approaches to explanatory methods especially for deep neural networks are insufficient. Finally, based on our survey, we conclude with suggested future research directions for explanatory artificial intelligence.},

More accurate models such as boosted trees, random forests, and neural nets usually are not intelligible, but more intelligible models such as logistic regression, naive-Bayes, and single decision trees often have significantly worse accuracy. This tradeoff sometimes limits the accuracy of models that can be applied in mission-critical applications such as healthcare where being able to understand, validate, edit, and trust a learned model is important. We present two case studies where high-performance generalized additive models with pairwise interactions (GA2Ms) are applied to real healthcare problems yielding intelligible models with state-of-the-art accuracy. In the pneumonia risk prediction case study, the intelligible model uncovers surprising patterns in the data that previously had prevented complex learned models from being fielded in this domain, but because it is intelligible and modular allows these patterns to be recognized and removed. In the 30-day hospital readmission case study, we show that the same methods scale to large datasets containing hundreds of thousands of patients and thousands of attributes while remaining intelligible and providing accuracy comparable to the best (unintelligible) machine learning methods.},

In this paper, we streamline machine learning algorithms for effective prediction of chronic disease outbreak in disease-frequent communities. We experiment the modified prediction models over real-life hospital data collected from central China in 2013-2015. To overcome the difficulty of incomplete data, we use a latent factor model to reconstruct the missing data. We experiment on a regional chronic disease of cerebral infarction. We propose a new convolutional neural network (CNN)-based multimodal disease risk prediction algorithm using structured and unstructured data from hospital. To the best of our knowledge, none of the existing work focused on both data types in the area of medical big data analytics. Compared with several typical prediction algorithms, the prediction accuracy of our proposed algorithm reaches 94.8% with a convergence speed, which is faster than that of the CNN-based unimodal disease risk prediction algorithm.},

There has been development of a variety of health-related smartphone applications. Currently, however, there are few to none applications based on nurses' historical or behavioral preferences. Mobile application development for the health care sector requires extensive attention to security, reliability, and accuracy. In nursing applications, the users are often required to navigate in hospital environments, select patients to support, read the patient history and set action points to assist the patient during their shift. Finally, they have to report their performance on patient related activities and other relevant information before they leave for the day. In a working day, a nurse often visits different locations such as the patient's room, different laboratories, and offices for filling reports. There is still a limited capability to access context relevant information on a smartphone with minimal recourse such as Wi-Fi triangulation. The Wi-Fi triangulation signals fluctuate significantly for indoor location positioning. Therefore, providing relevant location based services to a mobile subscriber has become challenging. This paper addresses this gap by applying machine learning and behavior analysis to anticipate the potential location of the nurse and provide the required services. The application concept was already presented at the IMCOM 2015 conference. This paper focuses on the process to ascertain a user's context, the process of analyzing and predicting user behavior, and finally, the process of displaying the information through a dynamically generated UI.},

The aim of the study was to investigate relationships between nurse practice environment, burnout, job outcomes and nurse-assessed quality of care. Background. A growing line of work confirms that, in countries with distinctly different healthcare systems, nurses report similar shortcomings in their work environments and the quality of care in hospitals. Neither the specific work environment factors most involved in dissatisfaction, burnout and other negative job outcomes, and patient outcomes, nor the mechanisms tying nurse job outcomes to quality of care are well understood. Method. A Nurse Practice Environment and Outcome causal structure involving pathways between practice environment dimensions and outcome variables with components of burnout in a mediating position was developed. Survey data from 401 staff nurses across 31 units in two hospitals (including the Revised Nursing Work Index, the Maslach Burnout Inventory, and job outcome and nurse-assessed quality of care variables) were used to test this model using structural equation modelling techniques. The data were collected from December 2006 to January 2007. Results. Goodness of fit statistics confirmed an improved model with burnout dimensions in mediating positions between nurse practice environment dimensions and both job outcomes and nurse-assessed quality of care, explaining 20\% and 46\% of variation in these two indicators, respectively. Conclusion. These findings suggest that hospital organizational properties, including nurse–physician relations, are related to quality of care assessments, and to the outcomes of job satisfaction and turnover intentions, with burnout dimensions appearing to play mediating roles. Additionally, a direct relationship between assessments of care quality and management at the unit level was observed.},
